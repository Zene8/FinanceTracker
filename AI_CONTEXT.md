# AI Context

This document describes how AI can be used to enhance the Finance Tracker application.

## Automatic Transaction Categorization

*   **Goal:** To automatically suggest a category for a new transaction based on its description.
*   **Implementation:**
    *   A simple machine learning model can be trained on the user's existing transaction data.
    *   The model will learn to associate keywords in the transaction description with specific categories.
    *   When a user enters a new transaction, the model will suggest a category, which the user can then confirm or change.
*   **Benefits:**
    *   Saves the user time and effort.
    *   Improves the accuracy of transaction categorization.

## Spending Insights

*   **Goal:** To provide users with personalized insights into their spending habits.
*   **Implementation:**
    *   The system will analyze the user's transaction data to identify patterns and trends.
    *   It will then generate insights such as:
        *   "You've spent 20% more on restaurants this month compared to last month."
        *   "You've reached 80% of your budget for groceries this month."
        *   "You have a new recurring subscription of $10/month."
*   **Benefits:**
    *   Helps users to better understand their spending habits.
    *   Enables users to make more informed financial decisions.

## Fraud Detection

*   **Goal:** To detect and alert users to suspicious transactions.
*   **Implementation:**
    *   An anomaly detection model can be trained on the user's transaction data to learn their normal spending patterns.
    *   The model will then flag any transactions that deviate significantly from the norm.
*   **Benefits:**
    *   Helps to protect users from fraud.
    *   Provides users with peace of mind.

## Financial Forecasting

*   **Goal:** To forecast the user's future financial situation.
*   **Implementation:**
    *   A time-series forecasting model can be used to predict future income and expenses based on past data.
    *   The model can also take into account upcoming recurring transactions and financial goals.
*   **Benefits:**
    *   Helps users to plan for the future.
    *   Enables users to make proactive financial decisions.
